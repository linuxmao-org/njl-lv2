This is a port to LV2 of Nick Lambs njl LADSPA plugins,
written by James Morris <james@jwm-art.net>

------------------------------------------------------------
To build:

make

To install for all users, system wide:

sudo make install-system

To install for just your user:

make install-user

------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:

This is my first attempt at programming using LV2, and also
my first effort to port a LADSPA plugin to LV2.

This is a beta release of the LV2 njl plugins, and as such
is subject to change in future. The LV2 URI for each
plugin is not yet stable - depending on how much interest in
this comes from the original developer, the URI may change
completely. It is suggested that before installing a future
version, you therefor un-install this version.
